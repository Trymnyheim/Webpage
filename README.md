## Interface

The frontend is built with a **React** application and hosted via **Netlify**.

I use **React Bootstrap** for styling and layout, making it easier to achieve a responsive design with minimal effort.

The application uses **React Router (BrowserRouter)** for dynamic navigation and **i18next** for supporting both **English** and **Norwegian** languages.

## Server-Side (Planned)

The backend will be implemented using **Node.js**.  
This part of the project is planned for a future development phase.
